  <h1>Hi, I'm Aybike.</h1>
  <p>I work with applied data analysis and machine learning, bringing together perspectives from engineering and social sciences. I care deeply about data quality, transparent assumptions, and how analytical results translate into real-world decisions.</p>
  <p>My focus is on building ML systems that work in practice—not just in notebooks—with particular attention to evaluation frameworks that reflect actual deployment constraints.</p>

      <p>An end-to-end ML pipeline that transforms public company disclosures into tradable signals on Borsa İstanbul. Features rigorous leakage prevention, exchange-aware timestamp alignment, and portfolio-level evaluation that accounts for real trading constraints.</p>
      <p>This project demonstrates practical ML engineering: from messy real-world data to production-ready signals, with evaluation metrics that matter for actual deployment.</p>
