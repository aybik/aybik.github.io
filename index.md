I work with applied data analysis and machine learning, with a background across engineering and social sciences. I care about data quality, assumptions, and how analytical results get used in real settings.

## Featured projects
- **Event tagging (NLP)** — transformer-based classification for messy, real-world labels
- **Entity extraction** — structured metadata from text with careful evaluation
- **Recommendation system** — neural embeddings + retrieval for explainable suggestions
- **Time-series analysis** — forecasting with attention to uncertainty and context
